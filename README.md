# Data Map App

This code base is set to create a web app for mapping data. Specifically, it uploads addresses and create a density plot on the map of the world. This can give insight to the frequency of events based on geographical location. This is a simple data analytical tool developed for a specific company to identify regions of concern based on business metrics. Both the business name and the data are not included.

## Use Cases and possible adaptations

Some example use cases could be:
1) Mapping where people are using your services for improved marketing (understanding your audience, finding untapped customer segments etc)
2) Mapping where you are losing customers (Clustering attition numbers by location, reason for leaving, etc)
3) Online purchases by location
4) ROI density plot (This can be achieved by changing the density to be by ROI instead of number of locations)

## Getting Started

This code base runs on Python 3.9. Setup of the conda environment can be done with the environment.yaml file. This can be easily done by installing Anaconda and issuing the following command in the data_map_app folder:
_conda env create --file environment.yaml_
